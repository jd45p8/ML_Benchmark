# SVM_Benchmark
This is a project for creating a python benchmark to generate an score based on the time that takes to train a SVC using SVM from Sklearn and the number of rows that has the data sheet.

# How to run
1. Install Python 3.7.
2. Open a CLI with Python access and intall *sklearn* and *pyqt5* Python modules.
3. Run *main.py* using Python.

# TO-DO
- [x] Fix the problem with *svm_thread* that stuck the program.
- [x] Transform the training into a stoppable process.
- [ ] Solve problem asociated with the dataset format that seems to be not compatible with the trainning model.
