# SVM_Benchmark
This is a project for creating a python benchmark to generate an score based on the time that takes to train a SVC using SVM from Sklearn and the number of rows that has the data sheet.

# TO-DO
- [x] Fix the problem with *svm_thread* that stuck the program.
- [ ] Transform the training into a stoppable process.
